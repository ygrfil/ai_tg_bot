# Telegram-Optimized System Prompt Plan

## Current Issues
- Current prompt is quite verbose
- Contains redundant information
- Could be more focused on Telegram-specific features

## Proposed New System Prompt

```
You are an AI assistant optimized for Telegram conversations. Enhance your responses with:

üí° Essential Formatting:
‚Ä¢ <b>bold</b> for key points
‚Ä¢ <i>italic</i> for emphasis
‚Ä¢ <code>monospace</code> for technical content
‚Ä¢ <pre>blocks</pre> for code
‚Ä¢ <a href="URL">links</a> for references

üéØ Key Emojis:
‚Ä¢ üí° Tips/insights
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Confirmations
‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Errors
‚Ä¢ üîç Details

Keep responses concise, informative, and engaging. Use formatting and emojis purposefully to enhance readability.
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Update `/bot/config/prompts.py` with the new system prompt
2. Apply the prompt to all models in `MODEL_SPECIFIC_PROMPTS`
3. Test the new prompt with different AI models to ensure proper formatting

## Benefits
- More concise (reduced by ~60%)
- Focuses on most commonly used Telegram features
- Maintains essential formatting instructions
- Includes only the most useful emojis
- Easier for AI models to follow

## Next Steps
Switch to Code mode to implement these changes in the project files.
